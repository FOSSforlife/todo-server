This is a simple server I set up which displays all my TODOs on a local webpage.

The "/richtext" view enables me to embed this in a KDE Plasma 5 widget on my desktop.

NPM modules used:
- express: for the server
- ejs: for the templating engine
- walk: to traverse the code directory
- leasot: to parse each file for TODOs
